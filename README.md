# Project Ramen 

Ramen is open-source Discord Bot application based on DSharpPlus.

Contributions, issues and feature requests always welcome.

#### Historical background

Ramen was originally created in 2019 and was written in JS. The main goal was to develop administrative Discord Bot for moderation purposes. In 2021 Ramen has since been rewritten in C# to fit quality and INVE Studios needs. Right now, Ramen works based on the unofficial .NET Discord API wrapper DSharpPlus (D#+).

#### Getting Started

Before attempting to read or use Project Ramen source code, make sure that you are familiar with the C# programming language and TAP (Task-based Asynchronous Pattern). If you are brand new in these aspects, this code may prove difficult for you to use.

So, you have cloned Ramen repository, after that you should install several NuGet extensions

`DSharpPlus`

`DSharpPlus.Interactivity`

`DSharpPlus.CommandsNext` 

and make sure that .NET Core 3.1 or .NET Framework 4.8 and higher is already installed on your machine.

After you have installed extensions, you should create simple JSON config file in the project directory. 

It should contain your Discord application bot token, any prefix you want and DB connection string fields.

Remember that you also should add config file into bin/Debug/net folder.
